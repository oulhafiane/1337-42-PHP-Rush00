# Subject
## Mandatory part
Following your first week of training on web, you will have to -in a weekend– create a mini e-commerce online shop.  
For those that don’t know what an online shop is, please check the list here. Note: It’s in french but most of the website listed have an english translation and it’s about getting an overview of the design and features.  
The tool you will use for your server from now on is PAMP, developed by 42.  
That one is still in beta, please help us make it better by bringing up the bugs you will encounter by ticket or on the forum.  
Of course, we won’t ask of you that it is as complete as some CMS generated websites, however, you will have some mandatory modules to develop.  
An e-commerce website must be able to manage the following features:  
• Data management: You need to implement, either your own data management (creation, modification and removal of data) in the format you want (ex: CSV), or using mysql. The data management is a key element to the design of your site.  
• User management: You must be able to create and delete a user account. The login to your site is essential before one can validate your basket, however, it can be possible to fill it before being identified. To do that, look at PHP sessions.  
• A basket: It must contain the list of products that your client wants to buy, the price and the quantity of each article, as well as the total cost. It must have a validation button to archive the order.  
• Categories and associated products: As for any e-commerce website, it requires to be able to organize the products by categories. So, one category can contain multiple products, but one article can belong to multiple categories.  
It’s up to you to conceptualize your data base before your start.  
• A landing page: That page is the showcase of your website, it must be attractive and intuitive so that your clients will want to buy. For that, the page can contain the connection section, the account creation, the basket and a preview of a few
articles and categories. The organization of your modules will improve the user experience.  
• Administrative section: In this section, we are asking come up with a way to give an exclusive access to some users. Those users will be able to manage the content of your site (add, modify, remove articles, categories and users)..  
In summary, a user must be able to register, connect, add articles in his basket and validate his order. Once validated, the order must be visible from the administration section..  

## Bonus part
To allow you to go further in the development of your e-commerce website, we are proposing some bonus features.  
To take these bonus points into account, we are asking you to have a fully functioninal website and to obtain the grade of 75.  

Here are a few ideas of bonuses that can be interesting:  
• Stock management  
• Itemisation of the articles (color, size, etc.)  
• Advanced users info  
• Captcha  
• API  
• Graphics/Statistics generation  
• Printable invoice generation  
• Registration/connection via Oauth  
You can inspire yourself from numerous existing e-commerce websites to find more bonuses to implement. You are particularly free to create as long as the mandatory part is respected.  

# Comments
It was very hard 48 hours for me and my team-mate  
In fact, we only had 30 hours  
Because we did not finish the Day04 exercises on time  
I did not sleep at all that night until I corrected the project  
We could not do everything we were told, but we did the majority
And we got 77/100 :)
